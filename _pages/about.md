# About Me

I am **Ziheng Li**, a Ph.D. student at **Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen**, working on data-efficient battery health prognosis and machine learning for real-world energy storage scenarios. My research focuses on addressing fundamental data constraints—such as insufficient samples, fragmented charging observations, and domain discrepancies—to enable reliable and scalable battery State-of-Health (SOH) and Remaining-Useful-Life (RUL) estimation in practical applications.

My work spans **few-shot learning**, **generative modeling**, and **early prediction**, integrating methodologies from meta-learning, conditional diffusion models, and uncertainty-aware prediction frameworks. Beyond battery systems, I also study **protein language models (ESM, ProtT5)** and mutation pathogenicity prediction under data sparsity, contributing toward interpretable and generalizable biomedical AI.

My long-term goal is to develop **data-efficient, robust, and deployable** prognostic tools for electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and broader real-world PHM applications.

# Current Research

### **Data-Constrained Challenges in Battery Health Prognosis**
Battery health assessment in real-world conditions often suffers from limited training samples, incomplete cycle information, and cross-domain discrepancies. My research addresses these challenges using:

- **Few-shot learning** for rapid knowledge transfer under scarce data  
- **Generative diffusion models** to reconstruct full battery curves from fragmented charging segments  
- **Early-cycle prediction** for SOH/RUL estimation using partial observations  
- **Domain-invariant feature learning** for cross-condition generalization  

These approaches collectively improve reliability, reduce testing costs, and accelerate the deployment of battery systems in EVs and energy storage stations.
